<h2>Bananas Are Berries, But Strawberries Aren't!</h2>
<p>It might sound bananas, but it's true! Botanically, bananas are classified as berries, while strawberries aren't. Strawberries are actually considered aggregate fruits because they form from multiple ovaries of a single flower. So next time you're munching on a banana, remember you're eating a berry!</p>
